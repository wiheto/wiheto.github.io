## The brain as a temporal network 

![]('./_static/connectivityclock.png')

My perspective is to view the brain as a system interacting over time. This involves quantifying the brain as a [network that changes through time]((https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/NETN_a_00011)).

### Theory 

_Coming soon_

### Results

When applying the different methods we have developed we are able to find different single trial behavioural properties correlating with temporal network properties (e.g. [fluctuating temporal communities](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/617027v1), [changes in segregation/integration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918304476)). We have also identified temporal patterns on resting state data that include a ["bursty" temporal pattern of network interactions](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39156)

### Methods

Several different time-varying connectivity methods have been proposed. The two most promising methods proposed are: the [jackknife correlation](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006196) and [weighted pearson correlatino by timepoint similarity](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/NETN_a_00011).  

We have also have proposed some [metrics to quantify temporal networks](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/NETN_a_00011) and a method for [temporal community detection from time series](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/617027v1).

### Software

[Teneto](https://teneto.readthedocs.io) is a python package for temporal network analyses. 

[TVC benchmarker](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006196) is a set of simulations that would test different methods ability to track a fluctuating covariance and gives the opportunity for other researchers to submit their method to be tested alongside..

## Meta-science

I am also involved and have been involved in a number of more meta-science project where the aim is to quantify how science is done and/or improve scientific practice.

One project demonstrated that the [readability of scientific texts is decreasing through time](https://elifesciences.org/articles/27725). 

Another project used Neurosynth to see how much the different [network terminology in neuroimaging literature overlaps](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep44259)
